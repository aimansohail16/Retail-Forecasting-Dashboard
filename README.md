# Retail-Forecasting-Dashboard
## What it’s about ?
- This project helps stores know how many products they’ll need in the future.
- It shows them when they might get out of stock or have too much.
- This way, they can order the right amount at the right time.
- This project basically aims to predict future product demand using historical sales data.

## Problem Statement?
- Retail businesses often faces two major problems:
  - Out of stock
  - Over Stock which is also called dead stock
- Both situations lead to loss sales or wasted money.
- Without proper planning, it’s hard to know how much of each product needs to be order or when to restock.

## Importance?
- It’ll help the sales manager to make better decisions, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
  - Let me give you an example.
      Imagine a shop or online store. They use old sales data (and also info like weather or sales promotions) to guess how much of each product people will buy in the future. A dashboard shows all this info in a simple way, so store managers can plan better. This makes customers happy and saves the store money.
 

## Tools Used:
- Excel (Used for quick data exploration, cleaning, and building initial pivot tables.)
- SQL (Stores, cleans, and aggregates data to calculate weekly demand, inventory status, and KPIs.)
- Python (Applies time series forecasting and anomaly detection to predict future demand.)
- Tableau (Visualizes historical and predicted data through interactive dashboards for decision-making.)
